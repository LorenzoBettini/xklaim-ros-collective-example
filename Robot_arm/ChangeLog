LORENZO:

fluent interface for JointTrajectoryPoint
fluent interface for JointTrajectory

removed coordination.Header, since it's just the same as the one taken from Ros: ros.msgs.std_msgs.Header

default new Header(0, new Time(), "") in JointTrajectory

default new Duration(120, 0) in JointTrajectoryPoint

method for single JointTrajectoryPoint
(we always use an array with a single trajectory point)

simplified JointTrajectory creation
